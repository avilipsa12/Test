## Problem Statement
The dashboard is designed to provide insights into the performance of car sales. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to quickly and easily access the information they need.
The Car Sales Dashboard is built using Excel and is designed to be updated with new data on a regular basis. The dashboard displays key metrics allowing users to understand how the business is performing overall.
### Key Insights
1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.

2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.

3. YTD Total Sales by Colour: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a pie chart.

4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

5. Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

6. Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information: Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc
